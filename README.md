# Network Attack Detection

Machine learning model for network attach detection based on Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. 

## Models

We evaluate ML performance from two perspectives: 
    
    (i) Multiclass classification - focussing on classifying 33 individual attacks
    
    (ii) Grouped classification - considering 7 attack groups (including: DDoS, DoS, Spoofing, Recon, Web-based, Mirai and Bruteforcing)
